# btmtools
## Hello this project is completely cancelled because this was a small hyperfixation I honestly don't care about anymore. Ty for understanding c:
A work-in-progress series of tools (will be library) for the BTM format, programmed in python.

You need to have the btm data stored in a file called "a.btm". The output will be named "b.bmp" or "b.png"

**ONLY THE PNG MODULE WORKS, DON'T TRY THE BITMAP ONE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T**
